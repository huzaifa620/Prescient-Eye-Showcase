ABOUT

Icarus Engineering is pioneer working on artificial intelligence (Computer Vision) based solutions for years. Designing smart vision based Video Content Analytics (VCA)
solutions.

Prescient Eye is a software based Video Content Analytics (VCA) that provides certain level of identification of real time alerts in case of unattended or suspicious individual, motion detection, unauthorized firearm detection, sucide bomber detection, anomaly detection or milicious activities like robery, stealing, assault, fighting, explosion, arrest or road accidents.

Icarus Engineering has expertise in developing AI and Deep Neural Network based VCA softwares that are used to detect, identify and distinguish various objects in live video feeds.

Prescient Eye System is capable of integration of following features also: 
	i) Real-time autonomus monitoring and survellience
	ii) Offline processing capabilities for data securities.
	iii) Encrypted transmission of data from CCTV to Central Server and analysis system.
	iv) Complete edge capabilities over data protection and threat analysis.
	v) Unsupervised learning automation model for continous training and processing.
	vi) 99% accuracy in terms of anomaly detection.
	vii) Vision basedÂ analytics.
